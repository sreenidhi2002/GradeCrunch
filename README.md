# GradeCrunch

UIUC CS 199 Kotlin Final Project

Freaking out about finals? Same here!
This is a simple android app that aims to help students by telling them what grade they currently have in the class 
and how much they need on the final to make a certain grade. 
If you're undecisive about converting a class to credit/no-credit, then this app is for you. 
You will be able to add in your grades for different classes and track them by specifiying the weight of each graded 
component and after viewing your current grade you can decide whether or not to elect cr/ncr for a specific class!
