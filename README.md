# GradeCrunch: A Grade Calculator App

## Developers: Sreenidhi Vijayaraghavan and Nireeha Yerramsetti

*“Where will your grades get you this semester?”*

GradeCrunch was an Android App that was created for our final project in CS 199: Intro to Kotlin. This is an app that utilizes the basics of Kotlin programming, API use, and Android App development as a culmination of what we have learned over the course of the semester. 
We decided to work together on our project after we realized that our independent ideas were in alignment with one another. We began our development by outlining what APIs we would use and how our UI would look and then began to program what we had visualized.

Our aim was to create an application to help students decide whether or not to elect a class as credit/no-credit based on their class performance this semester following recent events. The app utilizes Adapters that act as a bridge between views and their underlying data providing us with access to the user’s grade inputs and the minimum grade they would want to achieve in the class to retain a letter grade on their transcript.

We believe that this app will help students who are indecisive about converting a class to credit/no-credit. Users have the ability to add in their grade earned, grade components, and weightage for different classes, and track their current progress. After viewing their grade the user can decide whether or not to elect CR/NCR for that class.

We hope to improve the app in the future by expanding it to include features that can support multiple classes at once and store them in online databases using user authentication, and calculate GPAs on different scales and points systems whilst offering the ability to determine what grade a student will need to earn on upcoming assignments in order to make a certain grade in the class or semester. We would also like to make it more user-friendly by improving our UI design by including more Android features.

The main challenge we faced in the development of this app was checking and communicating a large amount of user input across activities and processing this input to yield a result. 

Overall, we can say that despite a few hurdles along the way, we found programming in Kotlin to be a lot smoother than working in a Java-only environment as the features available were simplified, easy to understand and even easier to use. Working on this project has given us an opportunity to work with Kotlin and see firsthand the advantages it offers and why its “Google’s number #1 choice for Android App Development”. Needless to say, we are both looking forward to expanding our view and working a lot more with Kotlin in the future.
